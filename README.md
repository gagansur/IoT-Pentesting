# IoT-Pentesting
Automation scripts to check if an IOT device has any exploits using nmap and nessus. Scripts are provided to run exploits 
# setup msf database
The first script check if the postgresql is running. If not running then it starts the process
# nmap scanning
scan for open ports on the target machine and report which ports are open
# nessus scanning
Once open ports are identified, the nessus report can be combined with nmap's report to search for possible vulnerabilities
nessus report possible vulnerarabilities using numbers, it's possible that these number exists on metasploits database as well. 
This information from nmap can be fed to nessus to narrow down search for possible vulnerabilities. 
e.g. if ssh is open on a target machine, then nessus can scan for ssh on port 22 and report vulnerabilities
# search and attack
once nessus attack are unsuccessful, it maybe turn to try out some possible search attacks using open ports using easy exploits
e.g. ssh_login is a bruteforce attack that uses weak authentication
